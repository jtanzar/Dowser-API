# Dowser-API

Dowser

This is the API for the Dowser mobile app. This API handles OAuth requests and authentication processes for the app, and connects the app to a mongoDB where we store users and their favorites. The server runs on Node.js with Express and uses OAuth 2.0, and uses Mongoose and mongoDB for database management.
